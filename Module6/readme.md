---

## Instructions

1. Open a bash shell in this directory.
2. Enter: <code>make all</code>
3. Run program 1: <code>./threadSync.o</code>
4. Run program 2: <code>./lab6.o </code>

## Description

This lab has two parts:

Part 1: We observe the use of semaphores to control access to a critical section in a multithreaded envrionment.

Part 2: We implement a solution to the producer-consumer bounded buffer problem through the use of semaphores.
