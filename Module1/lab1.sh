# Title: Lab 1 â€“ Unix/Linux Commands and Basic Shell Programming   #
# Description: This script performs simple user verification by    #
# checking the currently logged in user against a pre-declared     #
# eligible user. If the user is allowed to procede, they are asked #
# to input three integer values. These integer values are used to  #
# calculate the areas of a rectangle and circle, respectively. The #
# calculated values are echoed back to the user.                   #
