# Lab 1 - Shell Scripting

---

## Instructions

Open a bash terminal in this folder and enter: <code>./run.sh</code>

You may have to set permissions using: <code>chmod 774 run.sh</code>

You do not necessarily need to use that command, but you will need to set the execute bit.

## Description

For this exercise, we focused on learning the fundamentals of navigating a Linux shell and implemented our knowledge through the creation of a simple bash script. The script performs simple user verification by checking the currently logged in user against a pre-declared eligible user. If the user is allowed to procede, they are asked to input three integer values. These integer values are used to calculate the areas of a rectangle and circle, respectively. The calculated values are echoed back to the user.
